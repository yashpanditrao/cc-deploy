There's no single right or wrong pitch deck format to use, although experts generally agree about the topics that should be included in a good investor pitch deck.
Note
Work that you completed earlier feeds directly into what investors are looking for:
The following outline contains a checklist of key topics that most investors want to see covered, along with comments about what should go on each slide. As a business founder, you should feel free to reorder the topics to suit your delivery.
Use your own judgment, and be sure to address the points that are most relevant for your startup.
Create a rough investor pitch deck by following the preceding outline. This exercise is useful even if you're a long way from being ready to pitch investors. It can help you to think through and articulate the key elements of your business. By sharing the pitch deck with others, such as mentors, you can get valuable feedback and sanity-check your thinking.
Tip
Create the structure of your presentation first, using bullet points to list the key takeaway messages. Next, fill in second-order points or supporting information. When you're happy with the structure, create some PowerPoint slides to match it, rather than the other way around. This approach leads to a much more coherent and naturally flowing presentation.
